    <h1>My Biography</h1>
        <p>I grew up in the Boston suburb of Needham, MA. Attended Eliot elementary school, Pollard middle school, and Needham high school. Spent most of my summers in Maine at Camp Micah. Fell in love with computer science my sophomore year of high school, while taking an intro to computer science course. Applied to Tufts University, where I now study computer science, have played for the frisbee team, and have had a radio show since my first semester here.</p>
